description: Manage Beidou auth tokens for prod APIs. Use when the current agent needs to handle `/beidou-auth` or `/beidou-auth status`, create and refresh tokens for the prod API bases `https://api-icenter.inbeidou.cn` or `https://api-scenter.inbeidou.cn`, and use the prod authorization link domain `https://api-claw.inbeidou.cn`.

# Beidou Auth

Manage a local auth cache for protected prod APIs.

Core behavior:

1. Read cached auth state from a local JSON file
2. Reuse the token if it is present and not expired
3. If no valid token exists, create an auth URL and start authorization
4. Poll `/v1/claw/auth/check` every 2 seconds for up to 5 minutes
5. On success, overwrite the JSON cache with the new token
6. If any protected API returns `401`, re-authorize, replace the JSON file, and retry once

## Environment

- Authorization link domain: `https://api-claw.inbeidou.cn`
- API base URL: `https://api-claw.inbeidou.cn` or `https://api-icenter.inbeidou.cn` or `https://api-scenter.inbeidou.cn`

Choose the API base by current agent family or system context:

- use `https://api-claw.inbeidou.cn` when the current integration belongs to the claw side
- use `https://api-icenter.inbeidou.cn` when the current integration belongs to the icenter side
- use `https://api-scenter.inbeidou.cn` when the current integration belongs to the scenter side

Use the chosen API base URL for auth API calls and protected API calls.
Expect the returned authorization URL to point to `https://api-claw.inbeidou.cn`.

## Fixed Rules

- Always use one of `https://api-claw.inbeidou.cn`, `https://api-icenter.inbeidou.cn`, or `https://api-scenter.inbeidou.cn` as the API `api_base_url`
- Never ask the user to provide `api_base_url`
- Treat `/beidou-auth` as the command to load-or-start authorization
- Treat `/beidou-auth status` as the command to inspect cached auth state

## Commands

### `/beidou-auth`

Run this order:

1. Read the resolved `auth_state.json`
2. If it contains a valid token, return the cached state
3. Otherwise derive request parameters, create the auth URL, display it to the user, and continue background polling until success, failure, rejection, or timeout, then save the new token on success

### `/beidou-auth status`

Do not start a new auth flow by default.

Read the resolved `auth_state.json` and report:

- whether the file exists
- whether `access_token` exists
- whether the token appears expired
- `status`
- `expired_at`
- `agent_id`
- `authorize_time`
- `updated_at`
- `request_payload`

If the file is missing, say that no cached authorization exists.
Also return the resolved cache path.

## Cache File

Do not hardcode any Codex-specific path.

Resolve the cache file path from the current agent runtime.

Use this order:

1. a host-provided writable state path for the current agent
2. the current agent's writable app-data or config directory
3. a writable workspace-local state directory for the current agent

Requirements:

- the filename remains `auth_state.json`
- the path is stable across runs for the same agent
- the path is writable by the current agent
- the path can distinguish different agent identities on the same machine

For barry-video, the resolved path is `~/.barry-video/auth_state.json`.

Expected JSON shape:

```json
{
  "api_base_url": "https://api-icenter.inbeidou.cn",
  "authorization_link_domain": "https://api-claw.inbeidou.cn",
  "access_token": "<token>",
  "expired_at": 1777022400000,
  "code": "AuthCode1234",
  "status": "success",
  "agent_id": 1001,
  "authorize_time": "2026-04-20 12:00:00",
  "request_payload": {
    "client_id": "barry-video",
    "client_name": "Barry Video",
    "source": "openclaw",
    "channel": "mac cli",
    "model": "gpt-5",
    "agent": "claw",
    "version": "1.2.3",
    "platform": "openclaw野生版"
  },
  "updated_at": "2026-04-20T12:00:00+08:00"
}
```

Treat the cache as unusable when:

- the file does not exist
- `access_token` is empty
- `status` is not `success`
- `expired_at` is missing
- `expired_at` is already in the past

Write the file atomically after every successful authorization refresh.
Always return the resolved cache path with responses that read or write the cache.

## Parameter Discovery

Before `POST /v1/claw/auth/authorize`, infer the request payload in this order:

1. system parameters or known agent-family identity
2. current repo name, docs, and recent files
3. existing auth examples, tests, or curl commands
4. current thread environment
5. recent user intent

Infer these fields:

- `client_id`
- `client_name`
- `source`
- `channel`
- `model`
- `agent`
- `version`
- `platform`

Rules:

- Prefer system parameters over generic project inference
- `client_id` must be a unique identifier for the actual agent in use
- The uniqueness requirement applies to agents including but not limited to `openclaw`, Feishu agents, DingTalk agents, `hermes`, and similar agent families
- Never use a vague shared value for `client_id` if it cannot uniquely identify the current agent instance or agent identity
- If the system already exposes a stable unique agent identifier, use that directly for `client_id`
- If the client is `openclaw`, use the `openclaw` identity and metadata
- If the client is a Feishu-series agent, use that Feishu agent's identity and metadata
- If the client is a DingTalk-series agent, use that DingTalk agent's identity and metadata
- If the client is `hermes`, use the `hermes` identity and metadata
- Use project context for `version` or `model` only when system parameters do not already provide them
- Do not ask the user to hand-fill these values unless the flow is truly blocked

Fallback defaults:

- `client_id`: `barry-video`
- `source`: prefer `openclaw`
- `channel`: infer from `mac cli`, `feishu`, `dingtalk`, or `self-hosted agent`
- `agent`: prefer `claw`
- `client_name`: prefer the actual agent name; if it cannot be discovered, use `Barry Video`
- other missing fields may stay empty if no reliable source exists

Always return the final inferred `request_payload`.

## API Rules

Interpret API results by response `code`, not by HTTP status.

- `code == 0`: success
- `code == 10010`: auth code expired, missing, or already consumed
- `code == 1`: server-side failure
- any other non-zero code: surface the server message and stop unless the user explicitly wants retries

## Authorization Flow

### 1. Create Auth URL

Call:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST '<CHOSEN_PROD_BASE_URL>/v1/claw/auth/authorize' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '<REQUEST_PAYLOAD_JSON>'
```

On success:

- read `body` as the authorization URL
- extract the `code`
- verify that the returned URL points to `https://api-claw.inbeidou.cn` when applicable
- display the authorization URL in the agent UI or response page so the user can click it and complete authorization
- start background polling immediately after the URL is shown
- do not wait for the user to send another message before polling

### 2. Poll Status

Call:

```bash
curl -sS '<CHOSEN_PROD_BASE_URL>/v1/claw/auth/check?code=<CODE>'
```

Polling policy:

- poll every `2 seconds`
- maximum duration `5 minutes`
- continue polling in the background after the authorization URL is displayed
- stop on `status == success`
- stop on `status == reject`
- stop on `status == fail`
- stop on `code == 10010`
- if 5 minutes elapse first, report `timeout`

Current normal states:

- `submitting`
- `success`

Treat `reject` or `fail` as terminal failure if the backend returns them.

### 3. Persist Success

When polling reaches `status=success`:

- save `access_token` immediately
- save `expired_at` immediately
- save `code`, `agent_id`, `authorize_time`, and `request_payload`
- overwrite the resolved cache file atomically

Important:

- `/v1/claw/auth/check` success is one-time consumable
- once success is returned, the backend may delete that auth code
- do not expect the same success payload to be fetchable again

## Using The Cached Token

For any other protected API under the chosen prod API base:

1. read the resolved cache file
2. load `access_token`
3. send:

```http
Authorization: <access_token>
```

If the call succeeds, keep using the current cache.

## Recovering From 401

If a protected API call returns `401`:

1. treat the cached token as invalid
2. start a fresh auth flow
3. replace the resolved cache file with the new successful result
4. retry the original API call once

If the retry still returns `401`, stop and report failure.

## Output Shape

For `/beidou-auth` or a refresh flow, return:

- `api_base_url`
- `authorization_link_domain`
- `cache_file`
- `token_source`
- `authorization_url` when a new flow was started
- `authorization_url_display: true` when a new flow was started
- `authorization_url_shown_to_user: true` when a new flow was started
- `code` when a new flow was started
- `request_payload`
- `polling_started: true` when a new flow was started
- `polling_mode: background` when a new flow was started
- `poll_interval`
- `poll_timeout`
- `access_token`
- `expired_at`
- `agent_id` when present
- `authorize_time` when present
- `updated_at` when present
- `refreshed_after_401` when applicable

For `/beidou-auth status`, return:

- `api_base_url`
- `authorization_link_domain`
- `cache_file`
- `status`
- `token_present`
- `token_expired`
- `expired_at`
- `agent_id` when present
- `authorize_time` when present
- `updated_at` when present
- `request_payload` when present

Prefer short command-style responses over long explanations.
